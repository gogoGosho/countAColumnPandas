Using the pandas and openpyxl modules, it counts the total sum of specific rows, do bear in mind the column's name has to be the same across the worksheets. 
In my case, the filename is "combined.xlsx" that is in the current working directory, you might have to change them.
i can prolly skip openpyxl and do it directly with pandas but hey..
